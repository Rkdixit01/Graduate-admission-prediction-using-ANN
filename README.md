# Graduate Admission Prediction 
# Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of graduate admission based on various applicant parameters using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It leverages the "Graduate Admission Prediction" dataset from Kaggle to build and train the model.

# Objective
To create a predictive model for graduate admissions that helps universities assess applicant profiles effectively.

# Today's Work
Data preprocessing: Handled missing values and scaled the features.
Model building: Designed and trained an ANN model for prediction.
Evaluation: Measured performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
# Requirements
Python 3.7 or above
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
